Hello, and welcome to my first passion project!

### A Quick Background
- I really wanted a personal financing app
- I couldn't settle on anything that's currently available on the market
- that's also free
- If I can't find it, then I'll make it
- Use this as an opportunity to experience building something from the ground up

- I also was using a couple of group expense splitting app
- I always got delegated to compute the breakdown for everybody lol
- The one I'm using had a couple of pain points that rendered them unusable in certain scenarios
- The alternative had me question, it's uhm, design choices
- thought that it could be linked to said finance tracking app
- one mega financing app yay

- Irdk how I wanted to track my finances
- (I'm currently ironing out a google sheet for it)
- I do sort of know what I wanted in a expense splitting app
  - so I started with this instead

# Introducing: Financier
- A start of something new
- The site of my personal financing mega app
- I had enough experience in developing in python and (React) JS that I wanted to try my hands on setting up a whole app and see the underlying mechanisms of the thing
- Also wanted to get down and dirty with CSS and HTML again, since I really want to transition into a more Front End oriented role

## What can it do?
- Right now, you can:
 - create groups
 - add members to the groups
 - create an expense covered by one person for another in the same group
 - suggest a way to settle up the owed money in the group

## Moving forward
- So right now, it's very bare bones
- Very hyperbasic
- Next up is actually being able to update and delete entries

### Besides that, here's an uncomprehensive list of what I want the app to do:
 - allow creating, editing, and deleting a payment/settlement
 - allow multiple people to pay for an item
 - allow an item to be for multiple people
 - allow specifying percentages/splits in how much a person pays/owes
 - take in receipts:
    - multiple people can pool an amount to cover the total of the receipt
    - specify who has to pay for each item of the receipt
    - note any additional fees for the items (e.g. service charge)
 - some tech stuff:
    - create a way to persist sessions and group info since right now, it's simply stored to the state
    - make web app to be more mobile responsive
    - create native apps
 - All this with the focus on making it super simple and sleek!
